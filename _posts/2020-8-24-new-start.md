OK, I am playing around with several static site generators, like this one (Jekyll), but also Pelican (written in Python) and the allegedly super-fast Hugo.

However, I am fooling myself once more. It is not about the tech, it is more about the process and the idea(s) behind the desire to write posts and share information.

If I don't figure out what I want, and how to organize it, this will be just another failed attempt.

So, let's dive into what I want. 
There are several different things I want:
- document my ideas and things I've learned, just for myself
- build a presence that reflect who I am (or am aspiring to be...)
- inspire other people

And then there is the ease of things: if it takes too much time or hassle, I tend to bail out, or just abandon.
